I need help with creating a database schema for a house takeoff software. Each
estimation will need to be it's own document, and it will have a lot of data
associated with it. For an example:

- Estimation Name
- Estimation Date
- ... (more fields relating to the estimation)
- Dimensions
  - Length
  - Width
  - Height
  - Rooms
  - Interior Walls Length
  - Exterior Wall Thickness
  - Windows
  - Doors
  - ... (more fields relating to the dimensions)

I'm not sure how to structure this in a database. Can you help me with this? I will be using SQLite for this project.
